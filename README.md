# Fake-Job-Posting-Detection-System

Developed a machine learning model for detecting fake job postings by analysing textual data extracted from job listings. 
Leveraged advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and recurrent neural networks (RNN), including the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, to accurately classify job postings as either fraudulent or genuine.
